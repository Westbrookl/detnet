Variables
=========

This example shows how to find variables and find information about them.

Let's consider the following c++ file:

.. literalinclude:: example.hpp
   :language: c++
   :lines: 5-

The following code can be use to find the variable named "c" using different
strategies, and to print information about it:

.. literalinclude:: example.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 6,7,8,17-27,29-
