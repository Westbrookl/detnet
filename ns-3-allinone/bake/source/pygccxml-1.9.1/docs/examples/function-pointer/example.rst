Function pointers
=================

This example shows how to work with function pointers.

Let's consider the following c++ file:

.. literalinclude:: example.hpp
   :language: c++
   :lines: 5-

The following code allows you to extract information about the function pointer:

.. literalinclude:: example.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 6,7,8,17-27,29-
