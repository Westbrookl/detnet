=======================
Functions and arguments
=======================

This example shows how to work with function arguments

Let's consider the following c++ file:

.. literalinclude:: example.hpp
   :language: c++
   :lines: 5-

The following code can be used to find the different arguments of a function and
do some basic operations on them:

.. literalinclude:: example.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 6,7,8,17-27,29-
