============================================
Searching for a declaration (using matchers)
============================================

This example shows how to search for a specific declaration using different criteria.

Let's consider the following c++ file (example.hpp):

.. literalinclude:: example.hpp
   :language: c++
   :lines: 5-

The following code will show you how to search for functions and variables

.. literalinclude:: example.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 6,7,8,17-27,29-
