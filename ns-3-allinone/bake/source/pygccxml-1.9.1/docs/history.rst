History and Credits
===================

History
-------

The original author and maintainer for pygccxml was Roman Yakovenko (2004-2011).

Holger Frydrych forked the project to work on python 3 support. Finally, Mark Moll
forked the project a second time to carry on the work of porting the code
to python 3 (keeping it compatible with python 2).

In Mai 2014, Michka Popoff and the Insight Software Consortium revived pygccxml
by setting up a git repositery on GitHub, hosted along with gccxml.

The full changelog can be found in the CHANGELOG.md file.
